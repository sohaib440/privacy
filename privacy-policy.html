  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 17, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how our app ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your personal information. This is applicable while using our social media scheduling tool running on <code>localhost</code> for development purposes.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Information:</strong> Name, email, and profile picture through OAuth when logging in via Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or other providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media Tokens:</strong> OAuth access tokens required to schedule and publish posts on your connected accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Post Data:</strong> Content you schedule, including text, images, and timing information.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser Info:</strong> Device type, IP address, and technical logs for debugging (during development only).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate and connect your social media accounts</li>
    <li>To schedule, post, and manage content on your behalf</li>
    <li>To improve and test the app features locally</li>
    <li>To track issues and errors during local development</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. We only interact with the APIs of platforms you authorize (e.g., Facebook Graph API) and do so securely using access tokens you grant.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>While the app is running on <code>localhost</code>, we store tokens securely (in encrypted form if applicable). Data is not shared externally or persisted in public databases.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke access anytime by removing the app from your connected social account settings.</li>
    <li>You can request deletion of your local test data by reaching out to the developer directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
  <p>This development app may use cookies or local storage for session management only. No tracking is performed.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This is a temporary development policy. Once deployed, this policy will be updated and publicly hosted under a valid domain name.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy during development, please contact the developer at <a href="mailto:dev@localhost">dev@localhost</a>.</p>
